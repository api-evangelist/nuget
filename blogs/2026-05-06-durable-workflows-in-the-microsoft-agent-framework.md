The Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) is an open-source, multi-language framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents. Since its preview announcement, the framework has added a workflow programming model that lets you compose multiple agents and other units of work into multi-step pipelines. You define individual steps called executors, wire them into a directed graph using a workflow builder, and the framework handles execution, data flow between steps, and error propagation.
